generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2010
    description: "The original Citroën C3 was a supermini designed to replace the Saxo in Citroën's lineup. Featuring a distinctive, rounded design with a high roofline that maximized interior space, it offered a refreshing alternative to more conventional competitors. The interior maintained the quirky design approach with a centrally-mounted instrument cluster on some variants and innovative storage solutions. Engine options typically included 1.1L to 1.6L petrol units and 1.4L to 1.6L diesels, paired with manual or automated manual transmissions. A Pluriel convertible variant featured a unique modular roof system that could transform from a hatchback to a full convertible. Production began in April 2002 in Europe and continued through 2010, with Brazilian production extending through 2012. This generation established the C3 as Citroën's core small car offering with a focus on comfort, space efficiency, and distinctive styling."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The second-generation C3 evolved the formula with slightly more conventional styling while maintaining distinctive Citroën design elements. Revealed in June 2009 at the Frankfurt Motor Show and launched in November 2009, it featured a key innovation with the optional panoramic windscreen that extended into the roof, creating an unusually airy cabin experience (marketed as 'Visiospace'). Built on PSA's PF1 platform, it offered improved refinement and safety features over its predecessor. Engine options expanded to include more efficient units, including new Prince-badged petrol engines and revised diesel options. The interior focused on comfort with improved materials and available features. A facelift launched in March 2013 at the Geneva Motor Show brought updated exterior styling with new chevrons, LED daytime running lights, and revised bumpers. This generation successfully balanced Citroën's traditional focus on comfort with increasingly stringent efficiency and safety requirements."

    end_year: 2020
    description: "The third-generation C3 featured more distinctive styling inspired by the C4 Cactus, with optional Airbump side panels for protection against minor impacts. Officially revealed on 29 June 2016, the design incorporated SUV-inspired elements with increased ground clearance and protective cladding, reflecting changing market preferences. Built on an updated version of the PF1 platform, it offered efficient PureTech petrol and BlueHDi diesel engines. The interior showcased Citroën's 'Advanced Comfort' approach with supportive seats, simplified controls, and a spacious, airy environment. Technology included a 7-inch touchscreen and connectivity features. This generation successfully positioned the C3 as a characterful alternative in the supermini segment, emphasizing comfort and personalization options."

    end_year: 2023
    description: "The restyled version of the third-generation C3 was revealed in February 2020, bringing significant visual and technological updates. The main evolutions focused on the front and headlights with new LED designs, updated chevrons and styling cues. New exterior colors were introduced including 'Spring Blue' and 'Rouge Elixir', with two new interior atmospheres called 'Techwood' and 'Emeraude'. The 2020 facelift maintained the same PF1 platform but featured refined engines and improved efficiency. In 2023, a new entry-level 'C3 You' trim was launched as the latest evolution of this generation. This facelift captured the visual and technical refinements that kept the third generation competitive until the introduction of the fourth generation."

    description: "The fourth-generation C3 represents a complete redesign with two distinct market versions. For India and Latin American markets, it was released on 16 September 2021 and produced since 2022, designed as a modern hatchback with crossover SUV styling. For the European market, the fourth-generation C3 was introduced on 17 October 2023 and entered production in 2024. Both versions are built on the Smart Car Platform (a new, more efficient platform from Stellantis) and feature radically new designs with wider, more modern aesthetics while building on the C3's iconic character. The European version features C-shaped LED headlights, an enclosed grille with Citroën's new logo, and a more refined interior layout. Both versions offer efficient petrol units and mild-hybrid variants, with battery electric variants available (ë-C3). The fourth generation successfully bridges cost-efficiency and modern design, appealing to global markets."
