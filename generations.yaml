    description: "The original Citroën C3 was a supermini designed to replace the Saxo in Citroën's lineup. Featuring a distinctive, rounded design with a high roofline that maximized interior space, it offered a refreshing alternative to more conventional competitors. The interior maintained the quirky design approach with a centrally-mounted instrument cluster on some variants and innovative storage solutions. Engine options typically included 1.1L to 1.6L petrol units and 1.4L to 1.6L diesels, paired with manual or automated manual transmissions. A Pluriel convertible variant featured a unique modular roof system that could transform from a hatchback to a full convertible. Production began in April 2002 in Europe and continued through 2010, with Brazilian production extending through 2012. This generation established the C3 as Citroën's core small car offering with a focus on comfort, space efficiency, and distinctive styling."

    description: "The second-generation C3 evolved the formula with slightly more conventional styling while maintaining distinctive Citroën design elements. Revealed in June 2009, it featured a key innovation with the optional 'Zenith' windscreen that extended into the roof, creating an unusually airy cabin experience. Built on PSA's PF1 platform, it offered improved refinement and safety features over its predecessor. Engine options expanded to include more efficient units, including the new PureTech three-cylinder petrol engines later in the production run. The interior focused on comfort with improved materials and available features like a touchscreen infotainment system in later models. This generation successfully balanced Citroën's traditional focus on comfort and design flair with increasingly stringent efficiency and safety requirements."

    description: "The third-generation C3 featured more distinctive styling inspired by the C4 Cactus, including Airbump side panels on some variants for protection against minor impacts. The design incorporated SUV-inspired elements with increased ground clearance and protective cladding, reflecting changing market preferences. Built on an updated version of the PF1 platform, it offered a range of efficient PureTech petrol and BlueHDi diesel engines. The interior showcased Citroën's 'Advanced Comfort' approach with supportive seats, simplified controls, and a focus on a spacious, airy environment. Technology included a 7-inch touchscreen, available safety features like lane departure warning, and ConnectedCAM, an integrated dashcam system. A significant facelift in 2020 updated the styling and technology offerings. This generation successfully positioned the C3 as a characterful alternative in the supermini segment, emphasizing comfort and personalization options over sportiness."
